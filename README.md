# IAED - First Project

The first project of the IAED class (Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures).

The goal of the project was to create a Kanban Board without a GUI.
You could interact with the Board via the command line.

The project was written in C and explored concepts like sorting algorithms, efficiency, and C structures.
